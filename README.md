# Extended Kalman Filter for Geostationary Orbit Tracking

## Overview  
This project implements an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** to estimate the trajectory of a satellite in a **geostationary orbit** using noisy radius measurements.  
The system combines **orbital dynamics prediction** with **measurement-based correction**, leveraging the Jacobian for system linearization.  
The implementation is carried out in MATLAB/Octave.

## Objectives  

- Model the nonlinear dynamics of a geostationary satellite.  
- Implement an **Extended Kalman Filter** for state estimation.  
- Compare the estimated orbit against the true orbit.  
- Quantify and analyze estimation errors.

## Methodology  

### System Model  
The satellite state vector:  
\[
x = [x, \; y, \; v_x, \; v_y]^T
\]

- **Prediction step:** based on orbital dynamics with gravitational constant \(GM\).  
- **Correction step:** based on noisy measurements of the radial distance.  
- **Jacobian matrices:** used to linearize both state transition and measurement models.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Time step for prediction:** `T = 0.0001 h`  
- **Measurement interval:** `Tmed = 0.1 h`  
- **Process noise covariance (Q):** accounts for model uncertainty in velocity.  
- **Measurement noise covariance (R):** derived from variance of radius measurements.  
- **Integration scheme:** Euler forward method for dynamics.  

### EKF Loop  
1. **State prediction:**  
   - Propagation of position and velocity using Newtonian orbital dynamics.  
   - Covariance matrix update with Jacobian of dynamics (`Fx`).  

2. **Measurement update (when available):**  
   - Radial distance estimation.  
   - Linearization via measurement Jacobian (`H`).  
   - Kalman gain calculation.  
   - State and covariance correction.
